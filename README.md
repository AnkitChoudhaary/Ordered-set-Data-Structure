# Ordered-set-Data-Structure
Welcome to a custom C++ Set library that provides functionality similar to the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
This project offers an implementation of a *Set data structure* designed to store unique integers in *ascending order*. You can perform a *variety of operations on multiple sets simultaneously, including insert, delete, membership checking, union, intersection, size calculation, difference, symmetric difference, and printing elements in sorted order*. 
Explore this library to understand how to manage multiple sets efficiently in C++.
